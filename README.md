# Hybrid-Cloud-Computing-for-R-6-6-Conterexamples
We designed a hybrid cloud architecture to explore the solutions for Ramsey numbers (6,6). This project implemented a combined algorithm with taboo search and simulated annealing. It integrated and utilized Amazon Web Service, Condor, Azure, Xsede and other super computing resources. It is written in C.
